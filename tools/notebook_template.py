        "At inference the Vision Transformer splits one normalized 3×224×224 tensor into 196 patches of 16×16 pixels, prepends a "
        "class token, runs 12 self-attention blocks and reads 1000 logits from the class token in a single forward pass; the "
        "pipeline applies a softmax and reports the argmax class plus the top-k classes with their scores. The input size is "
        "fixed at 224×224 by the checkpoint, so every image is resized and center-cropped to it. "
        "**No adaptation occurs:** no training, fine-tuning, in-context conditioning, or preprocessing fitting happens "
        "in this notebook — the upstream checkpoint supplies the weights and the preprocessing configuration, and the "
        "carried pipeline module adds snapshot verification, input validation, a fixed output contract and the "
        "`top_k_accuracy`, `validate_inputs` and `evaluation_report` helpers. The default sample is a synthetic image "
        "generated in code; its prediction is demonstration (plumbing) evidence, not a production-quality or benchmark claim."

        "install the pinned runtime, read what the carried pipeline module guarantees, resolve and digest-verify the "

        "an optional BYOD path, produce an evaluation report that is `sample-sanity` only when a ground-truth class index "

        "extraction, or any training. The label space is fixed to the 1000 ImageNet-1k classes; an image whose subject "
        "is outside that space still receives a label."

Optional BYOD upload is gated off by default so the sample path can run top-to-bottom without interaction. Expected BYOD input: one image file decodable by Pillow (PNG/JPEG/WebP and similar), any colour mode, longest side at most 4096 px. Do not upload confidential or restricted data to a hosted notebook environment unless you are authorized to do so.
